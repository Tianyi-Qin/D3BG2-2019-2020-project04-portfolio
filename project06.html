    <p>NERGI is a fruit native to Asia and recently appeared on the French market. It is cultivated in particular in the Southwest.
It is the fruit of a climbing vine shrub. It looks like a mini kiwi but has different natural characteristics: it can be eaten entirely (edible skin, without "hairs") and reveals a sweeter taste. Rich in vitamin C, calcium and phosphorus in particular, it is excellent for health, even if it is first consumed for pleasure, at any time (dessert, appetizers, snack, aperitif ...) as is or in recipes (salads, pies, donuts, verrines, toast ...), very freely. It is sold in trays in the fruit department
and berries. It is marketed in the fall.</p>
    <p>Here I chose to try to present this poster in the form of illustrations, arouse the curiosity of young people, and express the vitality of young people.</p>
